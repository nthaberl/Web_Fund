        <h4>I also love traveling and try to do as much as I can while I'm still young and healthy, unfortunately with a worldwide pandemic that's been a little more difficult to do.
            Here are several vacations I had planned in 2020 that COVID decided wouldn't be happening:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 week trip to Japan</li>
                    <li>extended stay in Taiwan</li>
                    <li>camping trip through Arizona</li>
                    <li>extended road trip along the Oregon Coast</li>
                </ul>
            
        <p>Although COVID put a damper on several travel plans, we <strong>*were*</strong> able to go to Maui for my birthday in September.
